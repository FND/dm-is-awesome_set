dm-is-awesome_set
=================

Yes, finally!  A nested_set for Datamapper that actually works!  .... at least
I _think_ it does. Please test this out and let me know at jnicoll@gnexp.com
if you run into any problems.  This readme will eventually have examples.  Until
then, check the RDoc's and you should be fine.

The latest versions of merb_datamapper by default use repository blocks which 
also enable the Identity Map. This plugin relies on dm_adjust which does not 
currently work with the Identity Map. Please add this line to your config/init.rb
file in your Merb project:

Merb::Plugins.config[:merb_datamapper][:use_repository_block] = false

If you want to activate the IM, simply wrap code in a DataMapper repository block
like so: 

DataMapper.repository do
 # Your code here
end

A quick note about discriminators:

This version enables scoping that can either include or ignore discriminators.
If you wish to scope by a discriminator, please include that column name in
the scope option. Otherwise this plugin will work with all rows regardless of
the discriminator column.
