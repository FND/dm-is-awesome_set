dm-is-awesome_set
=================

Yes, finally!  A nested_set for Datamapper that actually works!  .... at least
I _think_ it does. Please test this out and let me know at jnicoll@gnexp.com
if you run into any problems.  This readme will eventually have examples.  Until
then, check the RDoc's and you should be fine.

A quick note about discriminators:

This version enables scoping that can either include or ignore discriminators.
If you wish to scope by a discriminator, please include that column name in
the scope option. Otherwise this plugin will work with all rows regardless of
the discriminator column.
